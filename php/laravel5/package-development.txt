如何在laravel5中使用package开发功能?

Using the laravel Workbench package:

You can add the illuminate/workbench package in a Laravel 5 by adding to your composer.json:

"illuminate/workbench": "dev-master"
then add the WorkbenchServiceProvider into your config/app.php file:

'Illuminate\Workbench\WorkbenchServiceProvider'
Now you need to create the config/workbench.php file since it has been removed from Laravel 5:

<?php

return [
    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Workbench Author Name
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | When you create new packages via the Artisan "workbench" command your
    | name is needed to generate the composer.json file for your package.
    | You may specify it now so it is used for all of your workbenches.
    |
    */
    'name' => '',
    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Workbench Author E-Mail Address
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Like the option above, your e-mail address is used when generating new
    | workbench packages. The e-mail is placed in your composer.json file
    | automatically after the package is created by the workbench tool.
    |
    */
    'email' => '',
];
Fill your infomrations in this config file then you will be able to use the workbench command:

php artisan workbench vendor/name
Creating your own package structure

In this exemple we will create our package called awesome in a packages directory.

Here is the package structure:

packages/
  vendor/
    awesome/
      src/
        Awesome.php
      composer.json
Vendor: your vendor name, typically this is your github username.
Awesome: the name of your package
src: Where you put the business logic
To generate a composer.json file you can use this command in the packages/vendor/awesome directory:

composer init
Now we create a Awesome.php class in the src directory with a simple method:

<?php namespace Vendor/Awesome;

class Awesome
{
    public static function printAwesomeness()
    {
        echo 'Awesome';
    }
}
After that we add the package to the laravel composer.json psr-4 autoloader:

"autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
        "App\\": "app/",
        "Vendor\\Awesome\\": "packages/vendor/awesome/src"
    }
},
and we dump the composer autoloader

composer dump-autoload
Now you can use your package everywhere in your laravel 5 project. If you need some laravel specific feature like service provider or view publishing, use them as described in the Laravel 5.0 documentation.
