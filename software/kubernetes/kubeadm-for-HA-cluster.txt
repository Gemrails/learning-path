How to create HA cluster with kubeadm, I see the external etcd cluster option. But it seems create master with different join-token every time running `kubeadm init`

dima.shmakov [6:37 PM] 
you should replace the /etc/kubernetes/   files from master 1, on the other 2 masters

jasoncodes [6:38 PM] 
sorry for bothering you.

dima.shmakov [6:38 PM] 
use the kubeadm just for placing your files , binaries and creating folders structure :slightly_smiling_face:

[6:38] 
it's ok np  :stuck_out_tongue:

jasoncodes [6:39 PM] 
ok. I see. Thanks.

Current production cluster setup
Installed 3 etcd nodes, bare-instance installation, endpoint: http://etcd-production.xxxxxxxxxx.local:2379
Used “kubeadm” official installation tool, one 3 master nodes, with further modifications after default setup completed.

might help

it's an internal doc i started writing when made it... but then the guys in team didn't used it .. everyone diggs stuff itself :smile: ...  so i didn't complete it

[6:40] 
may help you a bit

jasoncodes [6:40 PM] 
the join-token is lying on somewhere in /etc/kubernetes, right?

dima.shmakov [6:40 PM] 
yea

[6:40] 
in tokens.txt  or something :smile:

jasoncodes [6:40 PM] 
Thank you, I will read it

dima.shmakov [6:41 PM] 
but you need only the 1st master, use everything from it, the token too.   discard the 2 other masters output, it's not needed.  by copying /etc/kubernetes  you actually kinda replicate your master 1  to others

[6:41] 
good luck

jasoncodes [6:42 PM] 
understood. thanks

dima.shmakov [6:42 PM] 
also my is on ubuntu

[6:42] 
on RPM based distro you'll have issues with cAdvisor (if not fixed yet) and heapster/grafana monitoring stack because of this

[6:43] 
so be careful not waste too much time to setup this on amazon linux or something :smile:   use ubuntu

jasoncodes [6:43 PM] 
great, I am using ubuntu

dima.shmakov [6:43 PM] 
on rpm based distro you'll probably need to do workarounds or purge it all and start from scratch on ubuntu (what we did lol)

[6:43] 
nice

[6:43] 
bye good luck

jasoncodes [6:44 PM] 
thx, bye

oob it doesn't work, but - create 1 master with kubeadm init.    then  run same command on 2 other nodes

[6:46] 
delete /etc/kubernets  on 2 other nodes.  and copy this folder from master 1.

[6:46] 
delete /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.json ,  and change    kube-apiserver.json  setting of etcd to point to external 3 node manually maintained etcd cluster

[6:47] 
kube master components will use the locking mechanism to elect a leader (kube-apiserver, controller-manager, etc'  are only operational 1 at a time. but they're smart enough to elect leader between themselves easily through a lock in etcd)

so your cluster will look like this approximately :stuck_out_tongue:

dima.shmakov [6:49 PM] 
just be sure to backup etcd and cluster state (state with    get something -o yaml)

i'm not saying it's the best way to setup HA cluster ever :smile:  just was my shortest path to HA cluster and I like it :slightly_smiling_face:

[6:51] 
before that - we had an HA cluster on Rancher, and it was awesome... just that my boss didn't liked Rancher and we got rid of it ...
